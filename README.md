# SNOW

I’m excited to share SNOW, the e-commerce application I recently developed using React Native. For state management, I used Redux Toolkit, and I fetched data from FakeAPI Store with Axios. 🛍️

📌 App Features:
✅ Login: User authentication
✅ Product Listing: Displaying products on the home page
✅ Add to Favorites: Saving favorite products
✅ Shopping Cart: Adding and viewing products in the cart
✅ Product Details: Viewing detailed product information

🔧 Technologies Used:
React Native
Redux Toolkit
Axios
React Navigation (Stack & Tab Navigation)
React Native Gesture Handler & Reanimated

Through this project, I explored key aspects of developing e-commerce applications with React Native, including state management, performance optimization, and user experience. It was a great learning experience!
